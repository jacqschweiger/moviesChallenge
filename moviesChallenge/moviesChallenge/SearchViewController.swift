/*
 A user should be able to search for movies or TV shows to then view them in a UICollectionView or UITableView (your choice).
 
 A user should be able to tap on a cell and see a detail view with information about the movie.
 
 If the movie contains "Leonardo DiCaprio" as one of its actors, then the cell and detail view should indicate that in some way.
 
 A user should be able to favorite films. These films that were "favorited" should be persisted using Core Data.
 
 Use MVVM.
